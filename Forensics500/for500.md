# Forensics500 Write-Up

File "splinter" is given for this challenge. When we check file type with "file" command, we will learn that this file is "tcpdump capture file".
Let's open this file with "wireshark"

All we see in here is USB data traffic.
Maybe we should search "USB data CTF" keywords.

We found an example for this question that asked in Google CTF 2016. It looks both challenges are same. 

So, we are looking for mouse movements or mouse coordinates. We are going to use same steps.

But first, let me explain arguments of tshark.

>tshark -r <file-name> -T <format-of-text> -e <field-to-print>

>tshark -r splinter -T fields -e usb.capdata > data.txt

It means we used splinter file with using "-r splinter" argument, "-T fields" used for selecting type of text format and "-e usb.capdata" for selecting pcapfilter.
When we read data file,we will see this output.

00:ff:01:00

00:fe:00:00

00:fe:00:00

00:fd:00:00

00:fb:00:00

00:fa:ff:00

00:f9:00:00

00:f6:fe:00

00:f6:00:00
...

Humm. Let's convert this strings to coordinates.

>awk -F: 'function comp(v){if(v>127)v-=256;return v}{x+=comp(strtonum("0x"$2));y+=comp(strtonum("0x"$3))}$1=="01"{print x,y}' data.txt > flag.txt

"00:ff:01:00" ff --> 0x$2 = x, 01 --> 0x$3 = y
That code takes hexadecimal value of x and y. Now, we have coordinate file. 

-1084 -79

-1084 -79

-1083 -80

-1083 -86
...

Gnuplot will help us.

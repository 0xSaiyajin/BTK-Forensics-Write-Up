# Forensics400 Write-Up

First,check file type with "file" command.
>file usom-forensics400
:data

In this question the following file type is given: "full memory dump".

We need to use Volatility Framework for solving this challenge.(https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility)

After installation progress, we'll learn profile of this memory image.

Usage:
>volatility -f usom-forensics400 imageinfo

Suggested profile: Win7SP1x86_23418

Let's check what processes was working on that image.

>volatility -f usom-forensics400 --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 pslist

Humm, some interesting processes. (notepad.exe,mspaint.exe)

Dumping processes:
>volatility -f usom-forensics400 --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 memdump -p 3012,3580 --dump-dir /home/user/Desktop

I think, Gimp will help us. First we need to change file type ".dmp" to ".data" 
>mv 3012.dmp 3012.data

Now, we can open these files with Gimp. You should change width,height and offset variables until you see something interesting.

Woah,look at this!

It says: 'flag is not here'. Thats pretty sad.

A different way must be followed.

Command line inputs:

>volatility -f usom-forensics400 --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 cmdline

It looks like flag.txt.txt opened with notepad.exe

Deep analyze required here. Dump of notepad checked out with strings command.(i will use strings 3580.dmp | grep 'http' for screenshot.)
Humm, i found lsass file ! God bless mimikatz!(https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)

![](https://github.com/SyraTR/BTK-Forensics-Write-Up/blob/master/Forensics400/files/strings.png) 

>wget http://siberyildiz.com/c69519658aa4f23627c63a4bc012dfbf/lsass

After downloading mimikatz, open command line as administrator. Copy lsass file into /mimikatz/x64/. Run mimikatz.exe(x64)

Final step:

>sekurlsa:minidump lsass
>sekurlsa:logonPasswords

Flag is: `OK4D4RD4Z02D3G1LD1`
